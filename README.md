# SAR-ADC
A Successive Approximation Register Analog-to-Digital Converter (SAR ADC) is a widely used ADC architecture that converts an analog input signal into a digital output using a binary search algorithm. It offers an excellent balance between speed, power efficiency, and resolution, making it suitable for medium-to-high-resolution applications.
